# Overview

I wanted to start learning the Unreal Engine as a tool for game development and arcitechtural design.

The game is incomplete but it is a building in which the player will solve puzzles to escape.

Unreal Engine uses C++ and it is a very good language to know. The project also makes use of pointers which is a concept I wanted to 
familiarize myself with.
